# SC-MIPS

A  simple single-cycle MIPS processor.

## Architecture
This architecture doesnot differ much from the one found in DD&CA by David Harris and Sarah Harris
![System Architecture](/docs/sc-mips.svg "System Architecture")

## SystemVerilog
The design employs modern systemverilog language features such as `interfaces`, `structs`, and `unions`. This approach helped in making the code more readable and easier to understand and debug.

## Future Work
The design is not fully verified yet.
Future commits will be added targeting UVM testing of the design.
